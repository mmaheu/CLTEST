Upgrade Notes
=============

The :ref:`Proxy Authentication <api/auth/proxy>` handler was renamed to
``proxy_authentication_handler`` to follow the ``*_authentication_handler`` form
of all other handlers. The old ``proxy_authentification_handler`` name is marked
as deprecated and will be removed in future releases. It's strongly recommended
to update :config:option:`httpd/authentication_handlers` option with new value
in case if you had used such handler.
