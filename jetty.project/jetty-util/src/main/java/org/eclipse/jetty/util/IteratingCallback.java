/** Iterating Callback.
 * <p>This specialized callback implements a pattern that allows a 
 * large job to be broken into smaller tasks using iteration rather than
 * recursion.
 * <p>
 * A typical pattern used with asynchronous callbacks, is the next IO is 
 * done from within the scope of the success callback.  The problem with this
 * is that if the callback thread is the same one that calls to IO instruction,
 * then recursion results and eventually a dispatch has to be done to 
 * avoid stack overflow (see {@link ForkInvoker}).
 * <p>To avoid this issue, this callback uses an AtomicReference to note 
 * if the success callback has been called during the processing of a 
 * sub task, and if so then the processing iterates rather than recurses.
 * </p>
 * <p>This callback is passed to the asynchronous handling of each sub
 * task and a call the {@link #succeeded()} on this call back represents
 * completion of the subtask.  Only once all the subtasks are completed is 
 * the {#completed()} method called.</p>
 *
